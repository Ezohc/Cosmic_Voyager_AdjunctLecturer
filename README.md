Cosmic Voyager is a simple space-themed game based on users' choices.

First, a UML Class Diagram was designed and then coding was carried out in accordance with this structure.
It was tried to provide as free a code structure as possible, and for this, an interface "Event" class and a base "Ship" class were created.
Additionally, variables and child classes were defined so that an event or a ship object could be added at any time.
While writing code, attention was paid to the use of smart pointers and this structure was created by using the projects at https://github.com/alptekinkarabacak.

When the code is run, it is recommended to enlarge the terminal as much as possible for a better view of ASCII arts.
Added cooldowns at the end of each event and ASCII arts to improve readability; there is a second cooldown after the ASCII arts and 3 seconds at the beginning and end of the events.

Coding was done by paying attention to const correctness, magic numbers, naming, smart pointers, single responsibility principle, memory leak, undefined behaviour and interface.
